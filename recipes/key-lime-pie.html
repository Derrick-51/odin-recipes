        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            When I moved from Lebanon to Florida spring of 1999, I brought with me my love for cooking and search for new recipes. The famous key lime pie was new to me. It was a friend's best dessert, and he used to buy it from Costco every time we go for shopping. I tasted the pie at several places, but they were missing that wow flavor. I kept playing with the recipe, and the right flavor is found. I live now in North Bay, Ontario, and we only get the Key Limes twice a year, so sometimes I substitute with fresh lime juice. I hope you all enjoy!!

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <!-- 1 -->
            <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

            <!-- 2 -->
            <li>Pulse the almonds in a food processor until finely ground. Combine the almonds with the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and salt. Pour in the melted butter and mix until evenly moistened. Press into a 9-inch pie plate.</li>

            <!-- 3 -->
            <li>Bake the crust in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 13 minutes.</li>
            
            <!-- 4 -->
            <li>While the crust is baking, beat the egg yolks in a bowl with the condensed milk, cream, and lime zest. Whisk in the lime juice a little at a time to thicken the custard. Pour the custard into the pie crust and return to the oven.</li>
            
            <!-- 5 -->
            <li>Bake in the oven for 15 minutes to help the custard begin to set. Cool to room temperature on a wire rack before covering loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerating overnight.</li>
